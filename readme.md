WebhookForward.NET
==========

WebhookForward.NET is an application that is used to read webhooks posted to CouchDB and repost the webhooks to a different URL
such as a locally running instance of an application that you are debugging.

This is loosely based on a nodejs application called hookforward that I had been using with varying degrees of success.
